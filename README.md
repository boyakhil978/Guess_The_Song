4) If you choose to select by artist a window prompts you to select artists by querying Spotify
5) If you choose to select by Spotify profile a window asks you how many users with a Spotify account would like to log in, and lets them log in one by one
6) Your songs and their details are fetched by SpotifyAPI and added to the pool of songs, in case of selection by artist all the tracks that satisfy a certain popularity threshold are added, in case of selection by Spotify profile the users' top tracks and a mix of tracks recommended to them are added
